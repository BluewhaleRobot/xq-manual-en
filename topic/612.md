# Recalibrate the chassis IMU<br>
Sorry: This tutorial is for users who purchased after September 2016

Applicable situation:

Before shipment, each chassis IMU has been calibrated, and theoretically normal use does not require recalibration. If after a long period of use of the chassis, it is found that the odom angle at the output of the chassis begins to have a serious flow, follow the steps below to recalibrate the chassis IMU.

Steps:

0. Place the chassis horizontally stationary, the following calibration process can not move or hit the chassis.

1. In the local virtual machine ssh login, enter the following command.

```bash
ssh xiaoqiang@192.168.0.xxx   -X
rostopic echo /imu_cal
```

2. Open a new window in the local virtual machine and login to the host again. Enter the following command:

```bash
ssh xiaoqiang@192.168.0.xxx   -X
rostopic pub /imu_cal std_msgs/Bool '{data: true}' -1
```

3. Wait 10 seconds. When the window in step 1 shows the following figure, it indicates that the calibration procedure has been started. Please terminate the topic issue command in step 2.

4.	Wait 2 minutes, IMU re-calibration is completed, now you can continue normal use without restart.
