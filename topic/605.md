# xiaoqiang tutorial (20) get vision odometer and display the xiaoqiang track in the rviz<br>
[Xiaoqiang Homepage](http://www.bwbot.org/en/products/xiaoqiang-4-pro)

1.Local ssh preparation section (Xiaoqiang host is the controlled end, local refers to remote control end) 

ssh remote login Xiaoqiang host, the following operation is entered in this ssh window if without special statement

```bash
ssh xiaoqiang@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  
# Please replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with Xiaoqiang's current actual ip address
# Start multi-window manager
screen
```

Screen usage please refer to this [tutorial](http://www.cnblogs.com/mchina/archive/2013/01/30/2880680.html)

Check if the `orb_init` package has installed

```bash
rospack find orb_init
```

Delete if it exists

```bash
cd ~/Documents/ros/src
rm -r orb_init
```

Download the latest version of [orb_init](https://github.com/BlueWhaleRobot/orb_init) from the Bluewhale Open Source Software Store and install it

```bash
cd ~/Documents/ros/src
git clone https://github.com/BlueWhaleRobot/orb_init.git
```

Check whether startup task is running

```bash
sudo service startup status
```

If runing is displayed, it means normal. If stopped is displayed, then restart it

```bash
sudo service startup start
# If you want to close this task, you can use this command
sudo service startup stop
```

Check system status

```bash
rostopic echo /system_monitor/report
```

If it is normal, the display is as follows

```yaml
imageStatus: True
odomStatus: True
orbStartStatus: False
orbInitStatus: False
orbScaleStatus: False
brightness: 0
power: 12.34432
```

If it is abnormal, restart the startup task.

```bash
sudo service startup restart
```

Start ORB_SLAM in another command window in screen

```bash
roslaunch ORB_SLAM ov2610.launch
```

Return to the previous screen window and wait for ORB_SLAM to start

```bash
rostopic echo /system_monitor/report
# If ORB_SLAM is started, the following is displayed
orbStartStatus: True
```

2.Native local operation section

This machine has been installed ros jade version of the robot system, the computer operating system is ubuntu14.04, ros can be installed to refer to this [tutorial](http://community.bwbot.org/topic/232/%E8%93%9D%E9%B2%B8ros%E9%95%9C%E5%83%8F%E5%8F%91%E5%B8%83).

Add this machine to Xiaoqiang's ros network, open a command line terminal locally, and add Xiaoqiang's ip in the local hosts file. 

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/hosts
Add to
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx xiaoqiang-desktop
Save and exit
Please replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with Xiaoqiang's current actual ip address
```

Join ros LAN

```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://xiaoqiang-desktop:11311
rostopic list
```

If the join is successful, the command line will output the topic on Xiaoqiang's host. For more information about setting up multiple ros machines online, please refer [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup).

Download the rviz [configuration file](https://github.com/BlueWhaleRobot/orb_init/blob/master/src/orb_init.rviz). This configuration file can also be copied directly from the orb_init package on Xiaoqiang's host to view the output path of the Xiaoqiang vision system.

Enter in local command line terminal

```bash
rviz
```

When the window opens, click on file->open in the upper left corner and select the above downloaded configuration file. At this time the interface should appear as shown below

3.In ssh in the screen to open a new window, used to start orb_init Xiaoqiang host, before the start to ensure Xiaoqiang around two square meters of free space, Xiaoqiang will move for some time

```bash
rosrun orb_init orb_scale.py
```

After orb_init initialization is completed, orb_init cannot be closed. It will continue to output the visual odometer topic. This topic is the content that the local rviz needs to display. At this time, a new window is opened to check the system status.

```bash
rostopic echo /system_monitor/report
```

If it is normal, the display is as follows

```bash
imageStatus: True
odomStatus: True
orbStartStatus: True
orbInitStatus: True
orbScaleStatus: True
brightness: 0
power: 12.34432
```

At this point we have already acquired Xiaoqiangâ€™s visual odometer

4.In ssh in the screen to open a new window, used to control Xiaoqiang move

```bash
rosrun nav_test control.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the movement of Xiaoqiang. Spacebar is stopped. Ctrl + C exits the program.

5.As Xiaoqiang moves, the rviz interface on the local machine will be updated to show Xiaoqiang's trajectory in real time. Our own test video is [here](http://www.bwbot.org/article/8). For more information on how to use rviz, see [here](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz).
