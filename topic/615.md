# Xiaoqiang's remote assistance function<br>
In order to provide you with better service, Xiaoqiang, which was released after June 2016, has remote assistance software installed by default. Through this software our technicians can connect directly to your Xiaoqiang to solve technical problems for you. Of course, you can also use your remote assistance to control your own Xiaoqiang more conveniently. The following describes the specific use of Xiaoqiang's remote assistance function.

If you can see that the thread called SharpLink is executing, the remote assistance has already started. You can also confirm the status of the program and execute the instructions in a simpler way.

```bash
sudo service sharplink status
```
If the terminal displays:

```bash
toxserver start/running, process 1069
```

This indicates that the program has been executed normally.

Remote connection Xiaoqiang
