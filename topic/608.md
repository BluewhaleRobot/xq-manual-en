[Learning ROS for Robotics Programming - Second Edition.pdf](https://www.bwbot.org/s/QXeFTH)

This tutorial is very basic, although the book uses hydro as an example, but also fully compatible with the kinetic version. Just replace the hydro string in the code example in the book with kinetic. After completing the Xiaoqiang [tutorial (1)](https://community.bwbot.org/topic/550), if you are not familiar with ROS, please read Chapters 2 and 3 of this book.
