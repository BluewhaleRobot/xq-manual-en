# How Ubuntu sets static IP<br>

The basic way of IP allocation

The way IP is allocated is generally determined by the router. The router has two modes: DHCP mode and static IP. DHCP is a dynamic way of assigning IP. The default router is this mode. In this mode, the computer can also set its own static IP. Of course, there is no guarantee that it will succeed. For example, the IP set by yourself may be occupied by others. It is also possible that the router will not assign you the IP you set because of the confusion. Let's talk about the various methods of setting static IP.

Several ways to set static IP

However, the premise is that you must have the management rights of the router, and the router should also support this setting function. First enter the address of the route in the browser and enter the management interface of the router.
