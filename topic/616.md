sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    cmake \
    g++ \
    git \
    google-mock \
    libboost-all-dev \
    libcairo2-dev \
    libeigen3-dev \
    libgflags-dev \
    libgoogle-glog-dev \
    liblua5.2-dev \
    libprotobuf-dev \
    libsuitesparse-dev \
    libwebp-dev \
    ninja-build \
    protobuf-compiler \
    python-sphinx

```

2．Install ceres solver

```bash
cd  ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/BlueWhaleRobot/ceres-solver.git
cd ceres-solver
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
sudo make install

```

3．Install cartographer

```bash
cd  ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/BlueWhaleRobot/cartographer.git
cd cartographer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
sudo make install

```

4．Install cartographer_ros

```bash
cd ~/Documents/ros/src   # Please modify the path to your own ROS catkin workspace
git clone https://github.com/BlueWhaleRobot/cartographer_ros.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

5．The installation is complete, start downloading the bag file for testing

Click the link below to download the file and save it to your desktop.

6．Start the demo, you can see rviz start and start to build

According to the computing power of the personal platform, the complete running time of this demo is generally between half an hour and one hour.

```bash
roslaunch cartographer_ros demo_backpack_2d.launch  bag_filename:=${HOME}/Desktop/cartographer_paper_deutsches_museum.bag
```

7．Save the map and end the test

```bash
rosservice call /finish_trajectory "stem: 'test'"
```
