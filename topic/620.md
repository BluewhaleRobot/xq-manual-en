[Cartographer](http://community.bwbot.org/uploads/files/1481259224698-2d-loop-closure.pdf) is a set of laser radar slam algorithm that was [open sourced](https://github.com/googlecartographer) by Google in September 2016. Its precision and effect are among the best in the industry. This article will demonstrate how to use Cartographer in the ROS Kinetic. Click to view the result video.

        cmake \
        g++ \
        git \
        google-mock \
        libboost-all-dev \
        libcairo2-dev \
        libeigen3-dev \
        libgflags-dev \
        libgoogle-glog-dev \
        liblua5.2-dev \
        libprotobuf-dev \
        libsuitesparse-dev \
        libwebp-dev \
        ninja-build \
        protobuf-compiler \
        python-sphinx
    ```

2. Install ceres solver

    ```bash
    cd  ~/Documents
    git clone https://github.com/BlueWhaleRobot/ceres-solver.git
    cd ceres-solver
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j
    sudo make install
    ```

3. Install prtobuf 3.0

    ```bash
    cd  ~/Documents
    git clone https://github.com/google/protobuf.git
    cd protobuf
    git checkout v3.6.1
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake  \
      -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
      ../cmake
    make -j 2
    sudo make install
    ```

4. Install cartographer

    ```bash
    cd  ~/Documents
    git clone https://github.com/BlueWhaleRobot/cartographer.git
    cd cartographer
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j
    sudo make install
    ```
5. Install cartographer_ros

    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents/ros/src   #请修改路径到自己的ROS catkin工作空间
    git clone https://github.com/BlueWhaleRobot/cartographer_ros.git
    cd ..
    catkin_make
    ```

6. The installation is complete, start downloading the bag file for testing

    Click the [link]( https://storage.googleapis.com/cartographer-public-data/bags/backpack_2d/cartographer_paper_deutsches_museum.bag
) to download the file and save it to your desktop.

7. Start the demo, you can see rviz start and start to build

    According to the computing power of the personal platform, the complete running time of this demo is generally between half an hour and one hour.

    ```bash
    roslaunch cartographer_ros offline_backpack_2d.launch  bag_filenames:=${HOME}/Desktop/cartographer_paper_deutsches_museum.bag
    ```

8. Save the map and end the test

    ```bash
    roslaunch cartographer_ros assets_writer_ros_map.launch bag_filenames:=${HOME}/Desktop/cartographer_paper_deutsches_museum.bag pose_graph_filename:=${HOME}/Desktop/cartographer_paper_deutsches_museum.bag.pbstream
    ```

    The created map file will now be generated in the .ros folder in the home directory. These two files (pgm and yaml) can be loaded in the map_server in ros.
